      Responsive web design resolves various problems that exist with adaptive design. One of the main problems with adaptive design is that the web programming files are managed separately for different devices and browsers. This approach reduces usability and is overall cumbersome for the developers to manage code for each platform separately. Responsive design resolves this issue by maintaining one set of files that works across various devices and browsers. This allows the developers to not worry about repeating changes for each separately maintained codebase. From the users' point of view, they don't have to remember different URLs respective to each device and this also reduces common mistakes in accessing the web site. From the system point of view, it reduces load time by directing the user to one codebase automatically instead of having a backend that chooses the right codebase depending on the userâ€™s device. It also helps the search engine find content quickly rather than crawl through many different versions of the website.
